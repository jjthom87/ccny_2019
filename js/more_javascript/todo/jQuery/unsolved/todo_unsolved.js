	/*
		Todo List
		There are 2 separate ways to do this

		1....
		Pure Jquery

		When the Add Todo Button is clicked,
		The todo is added to the dom with a Red X Button next to it
		When the Red X button is clicked, using jQuery remove,
		delete that Todo & Red X Button
		Num is associated with each todo, hint: data

		2....
		Adding todos to array
		When the Add Todo Button is clicked,
		The todo is added to the dom with a Red X Button next to it
		as well as added to an array as an object with an id and a todo
		Hint: Num is the Id
		
		When the Red X button is clicked,
		splice that todo item from the array,
		and then append whatever is left in the array to the dom,
		with the Todo and the Red X Button
